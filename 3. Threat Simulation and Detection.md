- Over 2000 SYN packets were sent by Kali
- Destination ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) responded with SYN/ACK
- All other port probes resulted in no reply as UFW was configured to allow only ports 22 and 80

- Server header: `Apache/2.4.52 (Ubuntu)`
- Missing security headers:
    - `X-Frame-Options` (prevents clickjacking)
    - `X-Content-Type-Options` (protects MIME sniffing)
- Server responded with:
    - HTTP methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD
    - No CGI directories found
    - ETag header may leak inode information (CVE-2003-1418)
- Apache version is slightly outdated (latest is 2.4.54)
- No critical vulnerabilities found
